**Today's Progress**: Worked on a couple of algorithm challenges, refreshed memory on retrieving API data, added basic HTML structure and API data for quote machine project.

**Thoughts:** Stumbled a bit with algorithms, but enjoyed working with JavaScript again.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress** Added ability to retrieve a new quote by pressing "new quote button". 

**Thoughts** I was finally able to refresh a div with a new quote after a lot of research. Compartmentalizing my code into functions really helped.

### Day 3: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress** Added CSS styling to quote machine project. 

**Thoughts** Flexbox made the centering of elements simple. I was hoping to achieve a simpson-esque look, may revisit this later to make it more compatible with my vision.

### Day 4: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress** Began Weather App project, added function to retrieve user's geolocation, linked to Open Weather Map API, displayed city name, temperature and icon on html page.

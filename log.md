### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress** Added ability to retrieve a new quote by pressing "new quote button".

### Day 3: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress** Added CSS styling to quote machine project. 

**Thoughts** Flexbox made the centering of elements simple. I was hoping to achieve a simpson-esque look, may revisit this later to make it more compatible with my vision.
